# Description

A website built using MERN stack ( mongoDB, node.js, express.js and react) which allow users to book cabs from a source to destination and shows them the available cabs based on shortest distance path and gives the users option to book from different types and prices of cabs.
The user gets notified through the Nodemailer email service used on the website, as soon as the user books the cab detailed mail is sent to the user about the price, timestamp of booking, cab name, etc. The driver would also receive the optimized route through their navigation system, ensuring they take the most efficient path to the destination.
